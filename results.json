            "Computers and Electronics: How to retain knowledge. Use spaced repetition. If you want to remember something, don't repeat it over and over to yourself-this is known as massed repetition. Instead, let some time elapse before you repeat it. Ideally, you want to try to retrieve the information exactly at the moment when you were about to forget it. The difficulty of retrieving the information correlates to how strongly you will remember it.\n\nFood and Entertaining: How to teach a dog to lie down. Have a yummy treat ready. Figure out what kinds of treats your dog likes and have them with you when training. Hold the treat in front of the dog so that he can smell it, but not eat it yet. Bring the treat back a bit so he knows he has to do something in order to get it from you. If you have already used a clicker with training, you can use the clicker instead of a treat for positive reinforcement, particularly if your dog has weight issues or is not hungry because he just ate.\n\nHula hoop: Then she takes a neon green colored hula hoop and spins it around her body. She demonstrates how to effectively use the hula hoop by holding the hoop up towards her chest. Then she begins spinning with the hoop on her chest.\n\nHealth: How to know when to call the doctor after mastectomy surgery. Identify which surgical procedure you'll have. The physical outcome of the surgery will depend upon how much tissue your surgeon removes. In some cases, muscle is also removed to prevent or remove cancerous tissue. This will have an impact on the amount of pain you experience and the potential risks for post-surgical outcomes. You should discuss the various mastectomy procedures available with your surgeon before the operation.\n\nFood and Entertaining: How to make gyro meat. Place 1 pound (450 grams) of lean ground lamb into a large mixing bowl. Alternatively, you can also use \u00bd pound (225 grams) of lean ground lamb and \u00bd pound (225 grams) of lean ground beef.. Add the minced garlic, dried oregano, onion powder, salt and pepper.  If you are using beef, you might want to reduce the amount of pepper to \u00bd teaspoon..

They are, from most stringent to least observant: chasidic (hasidic), orthodox, conservative, reform, and reconstructionist. Keep in mind that each of these main branches have several sub-branches with varying degrees of differences. Ask your jewish friends which branch (es) they practice and how to behave.. Understand that followers of chasidic and orthodox judaism, generally wear modest attire that is not overly revealing.\n\nHome and Garden: How to survive a mudslide. Monitor the news and evacuate when recommended. If your area has been recently hit by a fire and heavy rain is predicted, start watching the news a day or 2 before the storm is predicted.

You could also create a defined contribution plan as an alternative. Instead of traditional health insurance, you can offer employees health savings accounts.\n\nFood and Entertaining: How to make parsley oil. Boil the water.

            "Home and Garden: How to grow sweet william plants. Find out when your sweet william will bloom. Due to the multiple varieties of sweet william and the different methods of growing them, you may hear conflicting information on when your flowers will grow and how long they will last. Biennial varieties bloom in their second year, and then die. Perennial varieties are supposed to regrow flowers year after year, but sweet william perennials usually take two years to bloom and often die before they bloom a second time. Correct care of sweet william perennials increases the chance of reseeding, as described in the section on caring for sweet william.\n\nSports and Fitness: How to build strength gradually. Choose the appropriate weight. When you're just starting out with exercise or you want to build your strength slowly, it's important to choose the appropriate weight. Too much or too little won't help you in the long-term.  The ideal weight is one that allows you to do one set of eight to 12 repetitions. Your muscle or muscle group should feel very fatigued at the end of the session.\n\nHand car wash: The front of a car wash building is shown. A guy talks to someone inside a black car. He opens the door and she steps out.\n\nRelationships: How to behave when flying first class. Mingle with people. The first class lounge is your first destination after the security check-point. It is a place where you can socialize with other people and share the destination you are going, and listen to others. You may be in the presence of high powered executives or even various celebrities. There have been many stories where people have flown first class and have been befriended by a celebrity and invited to an upcoming party or vip event.\n\nFood and Entertaining: How to oven dry bread. Preheat your oven to 250 degrees fahrenheit (121.1 degrees celsius).. Slice a loaf of bread or use pre-sliced bread.. Cut the slices of bread into small cubes to be oven-dried.  Spread the cubed bread evenly on a metal baking sheet..

A local defense attorney will also have a better understanding of how prosecutors in your area approach plea bargaining.\n\nPets and Animals: How to introduce your dog to its new home.

            "Holidays and Traditions: How to get around seattle on the cheap. Ride the seattle metro transit bus system all around seattle. Buses travel from the northern-most sections of seattle, including shoreline and south auburn, and reach from the western coast to the eastern fall city area. As of 2015, rates for riding the bus outside the downtown area start at $1.50 for children and senior citizens and reach $3.50 during peak hours. Bring your bike on the bus for free. Combine a bicycle tour of the outer areas of seattle with the convenience of riding the metro transit bus.\n\nHealth: How to avoid cramps while running. Do not run on a full stomach. If you drink or eat too much before running, you will be more likely to experience cramps during your run. You can eat just a small, healthy snack (no more than 200 calories) about one hour before you run to provide a little extra energy. A granola bar, half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a few slices of apple, or a banana are good options. After eating a larger meal, waiting two to four hours before running may help prevent cramping.\n\nRelationships: How to practice openness in a relationship. Choose good times to talk. If you want to foster open conversation, talk regularly. Be on the lookout for times to talk to your partner, especially if you're bringing up a potentially touchy or stressful subject.  Talk at a time free of outside distractions. For example, stop your partner to talk when they're lounging in the living room after dinner.\n\nPolishing shoes: An older man shines a shoe and talks about how he shines shoes and how he learned to shine shoes as a child. The same man is shown shining another mans shoes. The same man shines shoes in a shop while other people sit or walk around.\n\nPets and Animals: How to keep a bamboo shark. Purchase a large tank. The most important requirement for your new shark is that you buy a tank that is large enough. A small juvenile can be kept temporarily in a 30 gallon tank. Very soon, however, you'll need a much larger tank : 180 gallons is the minimum size for these sharks. Bamboo sharks are bottom dwellers and will rarely come up to the top of the tank.\n\nMaking a lemonade: Ingredients are sitting on a wooden block. A person",
